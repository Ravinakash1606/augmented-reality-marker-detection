INTRODUCTION: This project focuses on detecting and tracking AR (Augmented Reality) markers in real-time using computer vision techniques. It uses markers like ArUco or AprilTags to superimpose virtual content over real-world views via a camera feed.

Applications span gaming, robotics, interactive media, education, and AR-enhanced navigation.

USAGE : Prerequisites Python 3.x OpenCV (opencv-contrib-python) Numpy

Install dependencies:

bash Copy Edit pip install opencv-contrib-python numpy Running the Program bash Copy Edit python marker_detection.py Make sure your webcam is connected and a printable AR marker is available in view.

TECHNOLOGY USED : Python 3.x – Primary programming language for implementing the detection pipeline. OpenCV (opencv-contrib-python) – Computer vision library used for image processing, marker detection, and pose estimation. The contrib package includes the aruco module. NumPy – For efficient array and matrix operations. ArUco Marker Library – OpenCV module for detecting square fiducial markers (dictionary-based). Camera Calibration (optional) – For accurate 3D pose estimation and perspective rendering using cv2.calibrateCamera().

CODE DESCRIPTION : marker_detection.py – Main script for real-time marker detection and augmentation. utils.py – Helper functions for drawing, transforming, or processing markers. calibration_data/ – (Optional) Camera calibration files for accurate 3D pose estimation. markers/ – Sample markers that can be printed and used.

WORKING : The camera captures video frames in real time. AR markers are detected using OpenCV’s cv2.aruco module. If detected, the pose (position + orientation) of the marker is estimated. Virtual elements (e.g., 3D cubes or overlays) are drawn on top of the marker in the correct perspective.

USE CASE: AR gaming: Place 3D characters or environments on a table. Robotics: Help robots localize objects or navigate environments. Education: Interactive learning tools using printable AR markers. Museum/Exhibit Enhancements: Overlay multimedia content on physical displays.

CONCLUSION : This project demonstrates how to bridge the digital and physical worlds using computer vision and AR techniques. With minor extensions, you can integrate this into larger AR platforms, robotics systems, or mobile applications.
